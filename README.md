# Make my App Material

## Goal:
The goal of this project is to take an already working app and make it work with google's material design. I will be using styles, colors,elevations etc to make it feels right at home with the rest of the OS.

## Material Guidelines:
The material guidelines are listed in https://material.google.com/. I have implemented that as required in the app.
